# Code review
## Initial code:
The starting code from the code review challenge was: 
```
public static string decorateTelephoneNumber(string countryCode = "", 
                                             string localCode = "",
                                             string telephoneNumber) {
    string str = "";  
    if (countryCode != "") {
        str = str + "+" + countryCode + " ";
    }
    if (localCode != "") {
        str = str + localCode + " ";
    }
    str = str + telephoneNumber;
    
    return str;
}
```

**Commentary:**     
After looking through the code, I did find some lines of code that could benefit improvements. The issues ranged from naming conventions to inneficient string operations and code readability concerns:
- There is a method named decorateTelephoneNumber. In C#, it's standard convention to use PascalCase for method names. Following such conventions ensures code consistency and readability.

- The method parameters are assigned default values of empty strings (""). Using null as a default for strings in C# provides a clearer distinction between "no value" and "an empty value".

- The code uses the + operator for string concatenation, which can be inefficient for frequent operations due to strings in C# being immutable.

- The method checks for empty strings using countryCode != "". C# provides helper methods like IsNullOrEmpty or IsNullOrWhiteSpace that are more readable.

## Improved code:
```
public static string DecorateTelephoneNumber(string countryCode = null, 
                                             string localCode = null,
                                             string telephoneNumber = null) 
{
    StringBuilder phoneNumber = new StringBuilder();
    
    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(countryCode)) {
        phoneNumber.Append($"+{countryCode} ");
    }
    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(localCode)) {
        phoneNumber.Append($"{localCode} ");
    }
    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(telephoneNumber)) {
        phoneNumber.Append(telephoneNumber);
    }
    
    return phoneNumber.ToString();
}
```

**Changes:** 
- Method Naming Conventions: The method name has been updated to DecorateTelephoneNumber from decorateTelephoneNumber adhering to the PascalCase naming convention of C# for method names. This enhances readability and aligns with standard practices.

- Default Parameter Values: The default values of the method parameters have been set to null. This approach provides a clearer distinction, making it obvious when a caller hasn't provided a specific value.

- Utilized 'StringBuilder': The updated code now uses StringBuilder for constructing the phone number. This is a more efficient way of handling string manipulations, especially when concatenating multiple strings, as it avoids creating multiple intermediate string objects.

- Enhanced Empty String Check: The conditions have been updated to utilize string.IsNullOrEmpty, which provides a clearer and more efficient way of checking whether a string is null or empty.

**Commentary:** <br>
&nbsp;  The updated solution, for the DecorateTelephoneNumber function demonstrates a combination of improved performance, adherence to coding conventions and enhanced clarity in its operation. By utilizing the StringBuilder class for manipulating strings the solution avoids the inefficiencies associated with string concatenations. This is especially important in situations where the function might be called repeatedly ensuring that the system remains efficient.

&nbsp; Furthermore the code now follows C# practices closely in terms of naming conventions and structure. For example using PascalCase for method names ensures consistency with C# coding styles making it easier for developers with the language to understand and maintain the code. Choosing null as the default parameter value of strings provides a clearer representation of when no value is provided by the caller improving the clarity of the method.

&nbsp;  Moreover by leveraging existing C# string methods like IsNullOrEmpty not does the code become more readable. It also reduces potential sources of bugs or misunderstandings.
Overall this improved solution achieves a balance between optimizing performance and ensuring code readability. It offers benefits, in execution speed while providing long term ease when maintaining it.
By adhering to established conventions, in C# it creates a feeling of familiarity and predictability which is extremely valuable, in collaborative development settings.
