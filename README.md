# SET09102 portfolio

This repository provides a starting template for your SET09102 portfolio.

Most of the initial content was removed, and worked on as an Agile based team on an educational module, whose tech stack included .NET MAUI and MySQL.

Please remember that you should think about your portfolio as something that you could
show to a potential employer in the future. Consider what that kind of reader needs from
you in terms of presentation. It will be a good idea, for example, to start each portfolio
entry with a brief introduction because the reader may not be aware of the context.
